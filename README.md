Welcome to the Operating System Development Project! This repository contains the source code and documentation for a custom operating system I’ve been working on. The project is aimed at providing a deep understanding of OS concepts and hands-on experience in low-level programming.

📚 Overview
This project is a simple operating system designed to demonstrate fundamental operating system concepts, including process management, memory management, and file systems. It’s built from scratch using C and assembly language.

🚀 Features
Kernel: Basic kernel with essential functionalities.
Memory Management: Simple memory allocation and paging.
Process Management: Basic process scheduling and multitasking.
File System: Implementation of a basic file system for storage.
Drivers: Support for essential hardware components.
🛠️ Prerequisites
Compiler: GCC for C/C++.
Assembler: NASM for assembly language.
Virtual Machine: QEMU or similar for testing.
Make: For building the project.

📝 Usage
Kernel Development: Modify kernel.c and kernel.h for kernel-level changes.
User Space Programs: Add user-space programs in the user directory.
Configuration: Edit config.mk for build configurations.
🔧 Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this project! Open issues or submit pull requests to help improve the operating system. Make sure to follow the coding guidelines and add relevant documentation.

📦 Installation
